## What is Substance Painter?

**Substance 3D Painter** is the industry's leading and most flexible 3D painting application, used by AAA and indie game developers and VFX studios worldwide. It features a wide array of super powerful and unique 3D painting tools, including dynamic brushes, particle brushes, and an integrated ray-traced viewport for unparalleled realism in real-time.

With Substance Painter, artists can enjoy:
- A non-destructive, layer-based workflow for maximum flexibility.
- The ability to paint directly in 3D with state-of-the-art brushes and materials.
- Automatic UV unwrapping and baking of mesh maps for a quick start.
- Real-time PBR (Physically-Based Rendering) viewport for accurate material representation.

Its extensive library of smart materials, smart masks, and filters allows for the rapid creation of complex surfaces like wear and tear, dirt, scratches, and more, dramatically speeding up the texturing process. Whether you are texturing a character, a weapon, a vehicle, or an environment, Substance Painter provides the tools needed to achieve photorealistic results efficiently.
